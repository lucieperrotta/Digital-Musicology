• Your assumptions and your hypothesis are well-stated.

	• Additionally state that you are only concerned about the progressions of the roots of the chords most of the time.

• From the plots, it is not always clear where cycles and repetitions are removed and where not. 

• The trigram heatmaps look good. They have to be discussed in greater detail.

• Center the ticks of the heat maps for each category.

• The log scale in the rank-frequency plot should be applied to both axes.

• The # in your equations have to be escaped using a backslash.

• Plotting the differences of the heat maps is a good idea! The results have, however, discussed in greater detail.

	• VERY IMPORTANT: Use one uniform color scheme, e.g. 0 is always white, 3 is always the same shade of red etc.

• All in all, the report of this milestone is hard to follow since it jumps back and forth between methods and plots. You are also missing the discussion of your results a lot. For the report, it is important to write up a self-contained and coherent story.
