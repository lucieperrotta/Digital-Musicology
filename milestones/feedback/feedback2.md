Dear Lucie, Lucien, and Jean-Baptiste,

We graded your milestone 2 submission with a 5.0.

Comments and suggestions additional to the oral feedback given in class:

• Good choice of the dataset.
• Please push the cleaned / preprocessed data to the repo.
• You wrote “As said above, the dataset was built to be as diverse as possible, so we don't expect any bias to modify our results”. Please revise this statement and discuss which kinds of biases are avoided by the annotation procedure.
• What do you actually mean by “... ascending or descending fifths in transition are particularly pleasant to the ear.”? On what is this claim based on?
• Number of songs for each root note should be a barplot (same for your last plot). Where are the roots with accidentals?
• Proportions of most used chords look like they are beta-distributed. Maybe that could be helpful later.
• The ticks of discrete x-axis do not match the bars (e.g. in “chord notes relative to the key of the song”).
• The distribution of chord notes relative to the key of the song is already interesting. Discuss & interpret your finding.
• We think you are on track according to the project timeline.

Kind regards,
Daniel
